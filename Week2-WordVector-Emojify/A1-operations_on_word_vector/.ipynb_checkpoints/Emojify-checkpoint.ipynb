    "## Using Word Vectors to Improve Emoji Lookups\n",
    "- In many emoji interfaces, you need to remember that ❤️ is the \"heart\" symbol rather than the \"love\" symbol.\n",
    "    - In other words, you'll have to remember to type \"heart\" to find the desired emoji, and typing \"love\" won't bring up that symbol.\n",
    "- You can make a more flexible emoji interface by using word vectors!\n",
    "- When using word vectors, you'll see that even if your training set explicitly relates only a few words to a particular emoji, your algorithm will be able to generalize and associate additional words in the test set to the same emoji.\n",
    "    - This works even if those additional words don't even appear in the training set.\n",
    "    - This allows you to build an accurate classifier mapping from sentences to emojis, even using a small training set."
